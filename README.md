Topic: pavement aggregate gradation estimation based on point clouds.

This is the code of the experiment part of a paper published on Automation in Construction (DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2023.105023). The experiment uses a hand-held laser scanner to scan the asphalt pavement to obtain point cloud data. We use point cloud data to estimate the gradation of asphalt mixture.
